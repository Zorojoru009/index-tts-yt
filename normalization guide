# IndexTTS v2 – Script Structuring & Pronunciation Stability Guide

## Purpose

This document defines **deterministic rules** for writing and preprocessing scripts so that IndexTTS v2 produces **stable, intelligible speech**, specifically preventing the failure mode where **“it is” collapses into a sound resembling “ft”**.

This guide is intended for **future AI agents** operating IndexTTS v2 (or similar autoregressive TTS systems).

---

## Core Insight (Non‑Negotiable)

IndexTTS v2 is **autoregressive and subword‑token based**. It does *not* preserve words; it preserves **acoustic probability**.

Low‑stress function words (e.g., *it, is, to, of*) are **sacrificed first** when:

* prosodic boundaries are weak
* speech rate is high
* duration is compressed

**“It is” is a known collapse point.**

---

## Failure Signature

### Symptom

* "it is" is rendered as a clipped fricative
* Perceived as: `ft`, `f t`, or hiss + stop

### Root Cause

* Subword token collision
* Missing or weak prosodic boundary
* Duration underflow on function words

This is **front‑end failure**, not vocoder failure.

---

## Hard Rules (Must Follow)

### Rule 1 — Never leave “it is” unprotected

❌ Invalid:

```
It is important to understand this.
```

✅ Valid (choose one):

```
It's important to understand this.
It is, important to understand this.
It is — important to understand this.
It is. Important to understand this.
```

---

### Rule 2 — Prefer contractions by default

* Use **contractions** for all common function‑word pairs unless formality explicitly forbids it.

Examples:

* it is → it's
* that is → that's
* there is → there's

Rationale: contractions map to **single stable acoustic templates**.

---

### Rule 3 — Force boundaries when expanding

If the expanded form *must* be used, **force duration**:

```
It is, without question, the only way.
It is — and always has been — the truth.
```

Punctuation = duration allocation.

---

### Rule 4 — Protect weak phrases with stressed neighbors

Add a stressed word immediately after weak phrases.

❌ Risky:

```
It is important to know this.
```

✅ Safer:

```
It is very important to know this.
It is absolutely necessary to know this.
```

---

### Rule 5 — Avoid long unbroken paragraphs

Generate at:

* sentence level, or
* clause level

Long paragraphs increase **duration compression errors**.

---

## Text Normalization Rules

Before TTS inference, **always normalize**:

* Expand abbreviations: `vs → versus`, `ft → feet` (if unit)
* Expand numbers: `10k → ten thousand`
* Avoid ALL CAPS unless spelling letters individually

Normalization errors propagate into acoustic collapse.

---

## Phoneme Confusion: FEAR → FAIR (Vowel Drift)

### Symptom

* The word **“fear”** is rendered as **“fair”**.

### Root Cause

* Vowel drift between /ɪə/ (fear) and /ɛə/ (fair)
* Insufficient r‑coloring under fast or neutral prosody
* Accent‑agnostic training data biases toward flatter vowels

This is **not** a spelling error. It is a **vowel resolution failure** under low stress.

### Mandatory Fixes

✅ Preferred rewrite (most reliable):

```
fear → feer
```

(orthographic elongation forces /ɪr/)

✅ Boundary + stress reinforcement:

```
fear — real fear
true fear itself
```

✅ Protective modifiers:

```
raw fear
deep fear
pure fear
```

❌ Avoid isolated usage:

```
fear is powerful
```

### Extreme Control (if supported)

* Force phoneme override: /fɪr/
* Slight duration increase on the token

### Agent Rule

> The word “fear” must **never** appear unstressed or sentence‑initial without protection.

---

## Duration & Style Constraints

* Avoid “fast” or “high‑energy” style prompts when clarity matters
* If duration control is available, **increase base duration slightly**
* Short words require **minimum phoneme time**

Fast + weak words = deletion.

---

## Known High‑Risk Phrases

AI agents should automatically rewrite or guard:

* it is
* it was
* it has
* there is
* there are
* that it is
* which is
* fear (→ fair collapse risk)

These should **never** appear raw in final TTS text.

---

## Recommended Preprocessing Pipeline

```
Raw Script
 → Text Normalization
 → Contraction Policy
 → Boundary Injection (commas / dashes)
 → Optional Duration Control
 → IndexTTS v2 Inference
```

---

## Example Rewrite

Original:

```
It is important to understand power.
```

Approved rewrites:

```
It's important to understand power.
It is — important to understand power.
It is very important to understand power.
```

---

## Mental Model for AI Agents

IndexTTS v2 optimizes **flow**, not **grammar**.

Weak words survive **only if structure protects them**.

If a word:

* is short
* unstressed
* common
* unbounded

→ it will be compressed or erased.

**Structure is authority.**

---

## Final Directive

> Do not ask whether the model will pronounce it correctly.
> Rewrite the text so it has no choice.

This is not stylistic preference.
It is **control**.
